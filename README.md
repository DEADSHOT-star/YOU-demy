## What is YOU-demy?

YOU-demy is a web application for learning inspired by Udemy. YOU-demy is intended to be a source of education where the instructors are self-motivated and passionate for the courses they create. Courses are created by those knowledgeable in a subject, and others enroll in the class if they are interested in the subject. This project was built in ~60 hours, but more features will be added as time allows.
